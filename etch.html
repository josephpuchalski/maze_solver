      <h2>Instructions</h2>
      <p>Click Create to generate a new grid (Recommended sizes are 25, 50, 75, 100)</p>
      <p>Simply drag the Green Square (Start Point) and Red Square (End Point) on the grid and click Solve to see the pathway show up in blue</p>
      <p>If you would like to see which grid blocks were processed by the algorithm, click Visual Solve</p>
      <p>In Visual Solve, the yellow grid block represents those still on the open list or those blocks added but not looked at. The purple represents grid blocks that were processed</p>
      <p>You can also create custom collison block simply by clicking any one of the grid which will then indicate by changing to black</p>
      <p>If you want to clear the previous calculated path, just click the Clear button! Have Fun!</p>

      <p>
        A path finding JavaScript program which utilizes the A* Algorithm to calculate the shortest path.
        The program also uses the same A* Algorithm to generate its own complex pathways for traversal demonstration.
        I wrote the program in mind to be easily integrated into other apps for point and click behavior with collision avoidance.
